## 🎯 The Problem

In a world where **"all-natural"** claims hide artificial ingredients and **"healthy"** labels mask harmful additives, consumers are left defenseless against sophisticated marketing tactics.

- 🚨 **73%** of consumers feel misled by food marketing claims
- 🔬 **"Natural flavors"** can contain over 100 synthetic compounds
- ⚠️ Many **"organic"** products still include synthetic preservatives
